# FileHippo Update-Check

## what?
Scraping FileHippo / Latest Category for new releases with PowerShell.

## why?
Because I have not found any better free source for automatically checking for updates.

## how?
Sadly FileHippo does not offer an API so I tried it with dirty HTML Scraping.
It reads a Textfile with the Package-Names (they must be quite similar to the ones listet at filehippo). An example with common packages is in the repo.

## next?
- nothing

## ok?
If you are FileHippo or any acquaintance and you dislike what I did, please tell me, and I will remove this repo and stop using the script.
